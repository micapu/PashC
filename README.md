# Pashc - A website name deterministic offline unique password generator



Pashc is a way of creating unique passwords for all your websites without using a centralised online password manager. 

Simply type your website name in and you will be given a unique password ender to a base password only you know.

I recommend you come up with a unique passphrase for extra security which acts like a salt for the website name to keep passoword enders unique per user.
